# 🌌 Physics Simulations: Celestial Mechanics & Fluid Dynamics

This repository contains numerical implementations of two classic problems in computational physics: the gravitational Three-Body Problem and a simplified Navier-Stokes model for thermal convection.

## 🪐 1. Three-Body Problem
Numerical simulation of the equations of motion for three bodies under mutual gravitational influence.
* **Goal:** Modeling the trajectories and chaotic nature of celestial systems.
* **Key Features:** Integration of Newton's laws of motion and visualization of orbital stability.

## 🌊 2. Thermal Convection (Simplified Navier-Stokes)
Simulation of fluid motion in a layer subjected to a vertical temperature gradient (Rayleigh-Bénard convection).
* **Physics:** Modeling the convective motion of a fluid layer caused by the temperature difference between the bottom (heated) and top (cooled) surfaces.
* **Key Features:** Velocity field evolution and heat transfer analysis through a simplified version of the Navier-Stokes equations.
