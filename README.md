# Physics Simulations: Celestial Mechanics and Fluid Dynamics

This repository contains numerical implementations for two classic problems in computational physics: the gravitational Three-Body Problem and a simplified Navier-Stokes model for thermal convection.

## 1. Three-Body Problem
Numerical simulation of the equations of motion for three bodies under mutual gravitational influence.
* **Objective:** Modeling trajectories and studying the chaotic nature of celestial systems.
* **Key Features:** Integration of Newton's laws of motion and analysis of orbital stability based on initial conditions.

## 2. Thermal Convection (Simplified Navier-Stokes)
Simulation of convective fluid motion in a layer subjected to a vertical temperature gradient, modeling Rayleigh-Bénard convection.
* **Physics:** Analysis of fluid motion caused by the temperature difference between the heated bottom surface and the cooled top surface.
* **Key Features:** Observation of velocity field evolution and heat transfer through a simplified version of the Navier-Stokes equations.
